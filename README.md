- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much as I can about everything I can
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can help with... which isn't much since my name says it all
- 📫 How to reach me... metric or imperial?
- 😄 Pronouns: yes i'm very pro nouns they're right up there with verbs in my opinion
